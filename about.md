<p>I'm a web developer, skier, hockey player, mountain biker, and yoga lover. I graduated from Penn State in 2012 with a degree in petroleum and natural gas engineering.
After working as a completions engineer in the oil and gas industry for a few years, I decided to pursue other passions of mine; ski instructing, tutoring, and of course, programming.  I currently live in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>I love engaging in projects that give me the opportunity to tackle complex problems at scale and learning from people who are
passionate about doing great work.</p>
