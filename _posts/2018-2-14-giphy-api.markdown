This app makes use of the Giphy API to search for music gifs (or any type of gif with the add button feature).

Click a music artist button to display the top ten gifs associated with that artist by relevance on the Giphy API. Once the gifs are loaded, click a gif to make it play. Click it again to make it stop.

Type in your own favorite artist in the box, and a new button for that artist will be added to the collection.

Technologies Used:
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Giphy API
* AJAX
